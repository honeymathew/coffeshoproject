            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,
            which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.
            The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa, and Madagascar,
            the Comoros, Mauritius and RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.
            Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans
            because of its caffeine content. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world.
            The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century
            in the Sufi shrines of Yemen.[6] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted
            and brewed in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee seeds were first exported from
            East Africa to Yemen, as the coffea arabica plant is thought to have been indigenous to the former.
            [7] Yemeni traders took coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the seed.
            By the 16th century, it had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa.
            From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.
