                Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.
                The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa, and Madagascar,the Comoros, Mauritius and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.
                Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humansbecause of its caffeine content. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world.
                The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century
                in the Sufi shrines of Yemen.[6] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted
                and brewed in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee seeds were first exported from
                East Africa to Yemen, as the coffea arabica plant is thought to have been indigenous to the former.
